# PythonCodes

I solved around 90+ questions while learning Python and this questions helped me understand and implement a lot of concepts.
I am attaching those files here. If you wish, you can have a look.

Note : The code contains solution code for around 90 questions. I am also attaching the questions file, and while running the code you have to provide the question number as input initially.
